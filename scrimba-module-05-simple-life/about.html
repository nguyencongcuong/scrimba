		<h2 class="post-title">My name is Stephanie and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
		<p><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I
			couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

		</p>
		<p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a
			home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
		<h3>How I turned things around</h3>
		<p><strong>I was on the
			verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
			sold my
			place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
		<p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was
			in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
		<h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
		<p>Now that I'm living
			a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
			to enjoy.</p>
		<p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
			it</strong>,
			and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
